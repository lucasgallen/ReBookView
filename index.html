			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p>
				As I completed my graduate study of mathematics, I discovered a passion for programming. Indeed, programming is a subject of analytic promise and creativity (not unlike mathematics) with all the hands-on qualities that is absent in maths. I've always enjoyed tinkering and creating tools that directly impact day-to-day life. Despite the rich, metaphysical elements of mathematics used to create tools for scientists, I'm more interested in creation that is accessible to a greater audience.

			<p>
				Now that I'm a graduated masters student, I plan to spend my newfound free time on developing this site and growing a portfolio. Ideally, in the future I will find employment as a software developer and start a career. In the meantime, I look forward to doing some freelance web developement.
			</p>
			<h2> About the Site </h2>
			<p>
				Since I'm a graduated masters student, I've found that I have plenty of free time to work on some of the webapp ideas that have been lurking around my cranium.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point in developement, I have only completed Conway's Game of Life (which you will find in the <a href="simulation.html">Simulations</a> section). I plan to add another app in the future to illustrate my skills in back-end developement and perhaps some knowledge of machine learning, codenamed "Busker".
