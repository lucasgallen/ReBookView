				Conway's Game of Life is a simulation that operates on four very simple rules:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the cell is alive and if the cell has either two or three neighbors, then the cell lives to the next generation.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the cell is alive and the cell only has one or fewer neighbors, then the cell dies.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the cell is alive and the cell has four or more neighbors, then the cell dies.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the cell is dead and the cell has exactly three neighbros, then the cell is born into the next generation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we consider a "neighbor" to be a living cell that is adjacent (including diagonally so) to the cell in question.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conway's Game is interesting because of how complex the simulation can get with a comparatively simple set of rules. To me this is has much to do with the mystery of life and the "ghost in the shell"; it's a clue to the question, "what is consciousness?" Before I get a bit too philosophical here, check out the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter#Books">Douglas Hofstadter</a>. In particular, <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i> and <i>G&#246;del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i> are of interest here.
