                        Pressing the play button below lets the game run continuously; pressing it again pauses the simulation.

                        Note, although the grid appears as a square, as far as the cells are concerned the grid is a torus (think the surface of a donut). This structure may be familiar to those who have played Astroids.

                        In other words, for any given row the left-most cell "neighbors" right-most cell and for any given column the top-most cell "neighbors" the bottom-most cell.

                <p>Conway's Game of Life is a simulation that operates on four very simple rules:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the cell is alive and if the cell has either two or three neighbors, then the cell lives to the next generation.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the cell is alive and the cell only has one or fewer neighbors, then the cell dies.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the cell is alive and the cell has four or more neighbors, then the cell dies.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If the cell is dead and the cell has exactly three neighbros, then the cell is born into the next generation.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>

                <p>Here we consider a "neighbor" to be a living cell that is adjacent (including diagonally so) to the cell in question.</p>
                <p>
                    Conway's Game is interesting because of how complex the simulation can get with a comparatively simple set of rules. To me this is has much to do with the mystery of life and the "ghost in the shell"; it's a clue to the question, "what is consciousness?" Before I get a bit too philosophical here, check out the work of Douglas Hofstadter. In particular, I Am a Strange Loop and G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid are of interest here.
