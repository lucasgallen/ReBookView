                    As I completed my graduate study of mathematics, I discovered a passion for programming. Indeed, programming is a subject of analytic promise and creativity (not unlike mathematics) with all the hands-on qualities that is absent in maths. I've always enjoyed tinkering and creating tools that directly impact day-to-day life. Despite the rich, metaphysical elements of mathematics used to create tools for scientists, I'm more interested in creation that is accessible to a greater audience.

                    Now that I'm a graduated masters student, I plan to spend my newfound free time on developing this site and growing a portfolio. Ideally, in the future I will find employment as a software developer and start a career in the field. In the meantime, keep in touch.

                    Since I'm a graduated masters student, I've found that I have plenty of free time to work on some of the webapp ideas that have been floating about in my head.

                    At this point in development I have only completed Conway's Game of Life. I plan to add another app in the future to illustrate my skills in back-end development and perhaps some knowledge of reward based machine learning, codenamed "Busker".
